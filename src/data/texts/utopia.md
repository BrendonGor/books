Thomas More's *Utopia* presents a fictional dialogue describing an ideal society on an imaginary island. It critiques the political, social, and religious systems of 16th-century Europe through the lens of satire and philosophical inquiry. The term "utopia" has since become synonymous with visionary or unattainable social ideals, and the text remains a cornerstone of political philosophy.
