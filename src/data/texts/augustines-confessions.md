Augustine's *Confessions* is a seminal autobiographical work that delves into the author's sinful youth and his conversion to Christianity. Written as a series of thirteen books, it combines personal narrative with philosophical and theological reflections. The text is significant for its introspective approach, influencing the genre of autobiography and providing deep insights into early Christian thought and the human condition.
