In this influential essay, Montaigne challenges European notions of savagery by comparing the so-called "cannibals" of the New World to the moral corruption of his own society. He introduces the concept of cultural relativism and questions the arrogance of Western superiority. *Of Cannibals* helped lay the groundwork for modern anthropology and skepticism.
