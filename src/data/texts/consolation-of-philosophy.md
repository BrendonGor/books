Written during his imprisonment, Boethius's *The Consolation of Philosophy* is a philosophical dialogue between the author and Lady Philosophy. The work explores themes of fortune, happiness, and the nature of good and evil, blending classical philosophy with Christian thought. It was widely read throughout the Middle Ages and significantly influenced medieval and early Renaissance philosophy.
