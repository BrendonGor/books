The *Kebra Nagast* is a 14th-century Ethiopian chronicle that narrates the origins of the Solomonic dynasty, linking Ethiopian kings to the biblical King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. It serves as a foundational text for Ethiopian national identity and the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, blending history, legend, and theology.
