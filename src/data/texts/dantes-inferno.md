The *Inferno* is the first part of Dante Alighieri’s *Divine Comedy*, a visionary journey through Hell. Guided by Virgil, Dante descends through the nine circles, each representing a sin and its corresponding punishment. The work reflects medieval Christian theology, classical influences, and Dante’s political commentary, shaping the literary and spiritual imagination of the Western world for centuries.
