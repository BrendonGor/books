*The Prince* is a political treatise that offers pragmatic advice to rulers on how to gain and maintain power. Often interpreted as cynical or even ruthless, Machiavelli's work is foundational in modern political theory. Its emphasis on realpolitik and the separation of ethics from governance continues to provoke debate and influence leadership discourse.
