In this influential letter, Jerome addresses Eustochium, a noblewoman who had vowed virginity. He extols celibacy, recounts his own spiritual battles, and warns against the temptations of Roman luxury. The letter is deeply personal, blending exhortation with theological reflection. It became a cornerstone of Christian thought on chastity, influencing views on gender, asceticism, and the role of women in the Church.
