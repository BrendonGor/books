Hildegard von Bingen's *Song to the Virgin* is a lyrical tribute to the Virgin Mary, blending rich imagery with theological insight. As a composer, mystic, and abbess, Hildegard's contributions to music and spirituality are unparalleled, and this song exemplifies her unique voice in medieval sacred music.
