A cornerstone of Sufi literature, *The Conference of the Birds* is an allegorical poem that follows a group of birds on a quest to find their king, the Simurgh. The journey symbolizes the soul's path towards enlightenment, delving into themes of unity, love, and self-annihilation. Attar's work has deeply influenced Persian poetry and mysticism.
